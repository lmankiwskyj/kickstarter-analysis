# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to assist Louise with her own play funding campaign.  

### Purpose
Show how different Kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze outcomes based on launch date, I sorted the data by the parent category of theater, then looked at the percentage of outcome types.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To analyze outcomes based on fundraising goals, I only included the subcategory of plays, then sorted the goal amounts into different tiers, and then calculated the	percentage of outcome types for each tier.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It took some time to sort the dollar amounts into tiers to analyze the outcome by different goal amounts.  Excel's "countifs" function works great once you have the right formula and criteria.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  December would not be a good month to start a theater fundraising campaign.  While May, June, and July have the highest rate of success, these also have the greatest number of campaigns starting.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  Fundraising for plays under $5,000 have the highest success rates and most failures were $45,000+.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set does not include any information on why a campaign had a particular outcome (were they all marketed the same, why were some canceled, etc.).  


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table showing the mean, median, and standard deviation for plays in the US.
